# GNSS_Engine
This is the Repo for my python based "From Scratch" GNSS Engine

To use this Repo, you must use the "Driver.py" file.
In the driver file you will find a main function and the imports for the other two main files.
I have done it this way to tidy up what I need to run.

In the future I may turn this into a GUI for the same effect.
The focus of this project at the present is to get the simluator portion of this running correctly.
